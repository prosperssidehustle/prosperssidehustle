Brian (Bass) is a native Texan from the “Dub”.  DFW.  Moved to Prosper in 2020, and has been playing bass since HS Jazz band and performing in bands since his college years.  Brian’s inspiration came from hearing the bassist slap a cool “rif” while playing saxophone in 8th grade jazz band.  “I want to do that”.  Early influences were Jaco Pastorias & Marcus Miller from the Jazz world and later discovered Phil Lesh of Greatful Dead and dove into the Jam Band scene that includes Widespread Panic to Dave Mathews.
